# guess_the_number

A beginner friendly, fun to play guess the number game made by using only HTML, CSS & JS.
It generates a random number between 1 to 100 and asks the player to guess it
The player gets a total of 10 chances to guess the number
If the number is guessed the highscore will be updated and user will see a winning message
else if the the number cannot be guessed within the finite tries, user will see the losing message
You can always reset the game using "Again" button but the highscore will not change.

Happy Coding ;-)
